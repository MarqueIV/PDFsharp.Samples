# Old PDFsharp 1.5 samples

These are the samples that came with PDFsharp 1.x.
They are included here to check compatibility.

The following modifications are made to make them run:
* New .NET 6 project file was created. This was done manuelly because the Visual Studio Wizard created to much garbage entries.
* `AssemblyInfo.cs` was deleted because today it is auto-generated by the compiler.
* `app.manifest` was deleted because its concepts are outdated.
* App.ico was deleted.
* `Process.Start` is modified to use a **ProcessStartInfo** with parameter **UseShellExecute** set to `true`.
  Otherwise the PDF file is not processed by the default PDF viewer installed on Windows.
* The C# code is reviewed and a little bit modernized.

The following breaking changes are fixed:
* **XFontStyle** is renamed to **XFontStyleEx** because **XFontStyle** becomes a new and slightly different meaning in the future.
* The Core build uses the **FailsafeFontResolver** because font resolving in Core build is not yet finished.

// TODO.
Use SystemFontResolver with Times New Roman etc.

# Bugs

* Annotation WPF has a font problem with WP font.
* Booklet links do not work.
* ~~XML documentation not part of the NuGet packages.~~
